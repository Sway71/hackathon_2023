To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
  * App will run on localhost:4000

The FE app is in Svelt (at this point) and is in its own project
  * Typically runs on http://localhost:5173

You'll also need a Redis server
  * `brew install redis` to install using homebrew
  * `redis-server` to start the server
  * Will probably start running at localhost:6379

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
